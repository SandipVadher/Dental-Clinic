        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment (RCT) is a dental procedure designed to save a
          severely infected or damaged tooth. It involves removing the pulp,
          which contains nerves and blood vessels, cleaning and disinfecting the
          root canal, and then sealing it to prevent further infection.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="procedure">
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          The procedure begins with the dentist administering local anesthesia
          to ensure a pain-free experience. An access opening is made to reach
          the infected pulp. The dentist then removes the infected tissue,
          cleans the canal, and shapes it for filling. Finally, the canal is
          sealed with a biocompatible material.

      <article id="tooth-saving">
        <h3>Tooth Saving</h3>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment is crucial for saving a natural tooth that might
          otherwise need to be extracted. By preserving the tooth's structure,
          RCT allows patients to maintain proper dental function and aesthetics.

      <article id="pain-relief">
        <h3>Pain Relief</h3>
        <p>
          RCT provides effective relief from severe tooth pain caused by
          infections or inflammation of the dental pulp. Once the infected
          tissue is removed, patients typically experience a significant
          reduction in pain and discomfort.

      <h2>The RCT Process</h2>

      <article id="diagnosis">
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>
          The process begins with a thorough diagnosis of the tooth, often
          involving X-rays to assess the extent of infection or damage. Dentists
          carefully evaluate symptoms, such as persistent pain or sensitivity,
          to determine the need for root canal therapy.

      <article id="cleaning-and-sealing">
        <h3>Cleaning and Sealing</h3>
        <p>
          Once diagnosed, the infected pulp is removed during the cleaning
          phase. The dentist uses specialized tools to clean and shape the root
          canal, ensuring all infected material is eliminated. After thorough
          cleaning, the canal is sealed to prevent recontamination.
        </p>

      <article id="restoration">
        <h3>Restoration</h3>
        <p>
          After cleaning and sealing, the tooth is restored to its full
          functionality and appearance. This may involve placing a dental crown
          over the treated tooth to provide strength and protection. The
          restored tooth can now function normally without the persistent pain
          or risk of further infection.
