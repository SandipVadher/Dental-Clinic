        <h3>Complete Dentures</h3>
        <p>
          Complete dentures are removable dental prosthetics designed to replace
          all missing teeth in the upper or lower jaw. These prostheses are
          crafted to resemble natural teeth and gums, providing full restoration
          of the smile and oral functionality for individuals who have lost all
          their natural teeth.

      <article id="partial-dentures">
        <h3>Partial Dentures</h3>
        <p>
          Partial dentures are removable dental appliances used to replace one
          or more missing teeth when some natural teeth remain. They consist of
          artificial teeth attached to a framework that clasps onto existing
          teeth for support. Partial dentures not only restore aesthetics but
          also enhance the functionality of the remaining natural teeth.

        <h3>Restoration</h3>
        <p>
          Complete and partial dentures are commonly used to restore a complete
          and functional smile for individuals who have experienced tooth loss.
          These dental prosthetics not only improve aesthetics but also play a
          crucial role in supporting facial structure and preventing potential
          oral health issues associated with missing teeth.

      <article id="functionality">
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          These dental prosthetics help in restoring the ability to chew, speak,
          and smile confidently. Complete dentures provide a comprehensive
          solution for those with total tooth loss, while partial dentures offer
          targeted restoration, maintaining the functionality of the remaining
          natural teeth while filling gaps caused by missing ones.

      <h2>The Process</h2>

      <article id="evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The process begins with a thorough evaluation of the patient's oral
          health, including an assessment of the condition of existing teeth,
          gum health, and overall oral structures. This evaluation guides the
          dentist in determining the most suitable type of denture for the
          individual's needs.

      </article>

      <article id="impressions">
        <h3>Impressions</h3>
        <p>
          Once the evaluation is complete, the next step involves taking
          impressions of the patient's mouth. These impressions serve as the
          basis for crafting custom-fitted dentures that will provide optimal
          comfort, functionality, and aesthetics. Precision is key to ensure a
          secure and natural fit.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="fitting">
        <h3>Fitting</h3>
        <p>
          After crafting the dentures, the fitting process ensures that the
          prosthetics align seamlessly with the patient's natural oral
          structures. Dentists make necessary adjustments to achieve a
          comfortable and secure fit, allowing individuals to regain confidence
          in their smile and enjoy improved oral function.
