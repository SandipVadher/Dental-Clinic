      <h2>What are Dental Implants?</h2>

      <article id="implant-definition">
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Dental implants are advanced dental prosthetics designed to replace
          missing teeth. They consist of titanium posts surgically implanted
          into the jawbone, acting as artificial tooth roots. These posts
          provide a sturdy foundation for attaching custom-made artificial
          teeth, ensuring a durable and natural-looking solution for tooth loss.

      <article id="components">
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>
          Implants typically consist of three main components: the titanium
          implant post, an abutment that connects the post to the artificial
          tooth, and the prosthetic tooth or crown. Together, these components
          mimic the structure of a natural tooth, providing both aesthetic and
          functional benefits.

        <h3>Tooth Replacement</h3>
        <p>
          Dental implants serve as a permanent and highly effective solution for
          replacing missing teeth. Whether it's a single tooth, multiple teeth,
          or a full set, implants offer a secure and natural-looking alternative
          to traditional dentures or bridges.

      <article id="bone-health">
        <h3>Bone Health</h3>
        <p>
          Implants promote optimal bone health by integrating with the jawbone
          through a process called osseointegration. This not only provides
          stability for the implants but also prevents bone loss, maintaining
          the integrity and density of the jawbone over time.

      <h2>The Implantation Process</h2>

      <article id="evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The process begins with a comprehensive evaluation to assess the
          patient's oral health, bone density, and suitability for dental
          implants. This evaluation may include X-rays, impressions, and
          discussions about the patient's goals and expectations.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="surgery">
        <h3>Surgical Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          Once the evaluation is complete, the implantation process involves a
          surgical procedure where the titanium implant posts are carefully
          placed into the jawbone. This procedure is typically performed under
          local anesthesia, ensuring patient comfort during the surgery.

      <article id="healing-and-restoration">
        <h3>Healing and Restoration</h3>
        <p>
          After the surgery, a healing period follows, allowing the implants to
          fuse with the jawbone through osseointegration. Once the healing is
          complete, the final step is the attachment of abutments and
          custom-made artificial teeth, providing a fully restored and
          functional smile.
