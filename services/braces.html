        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Dental braces are orthodontic devices designed to correct teeth
          misalignment and improve the overall alignment of the jaw. They
          consist of various components, working together to gradually move
          teeth into their desired positions for a straighter and more
          aesthetically pleasing smile.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="components">
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>
          Braces typically consist of brackets, which are attached to each
          tooth, and wires that run through the brackets. Additionally, elastic
          bands and other accessories may be used to apply pressure and guide
          tooth movement. Over time, these components work in tandem to achieve
          the desired teeth alignment.

        <h3>Teeth Alignment</h3>
        <p>
          Dental braces are commonly used to correct misaligned teeth,
          addressing issues such as overcrowding, gaps, and crooked teeth. By
          gradually shifting the position of the teeth, braces help create a
          more harmonious and well-aligned smile.

        <h3>Bite Correction</h3>
        <p>
          Braces play a crucial role in bite correction, addressing problems
          like overbites, underbites, and crossbites. By aligning the upper and
          lower teeth properly, braces contribute to improved bite
          functionality, reducing the risk of dental issues and enhancing
          overall oral health.

      <h2>The Braces Process</h2>

      <article id="evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The process begins with a thorough evaluation of the patient's oral
          health, including X-rays, impressions, and a discussion of the
          individual's orthodontic goals. This evaluation guides the
          orthodontist in developing a personalized treatment plan.

      <article id="installation">
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>
          Once the evaluation is complete, the braces installation process
          involves attaching brackets to each tooth and threading wires through
          the brackets. This initial step sets the foundation for the gradual
          adjustment and alignment of the teeth throughout the treatment period.

      <article id="adjustments">
        <h3>Periodic Adjustments</h3>

        <p>
          Throughout the treatment, periodic adjustments are made to the braces.
          Orthodontists may tighten wires, replace elastic bands, or make other
          modifications to ensure a consistent and effective force is applied to
          guide teeth movement. These adjustments are crucial for achieving
          optimal results.
