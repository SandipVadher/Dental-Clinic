      <article id="dental-crowns">
        <h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
        <p>
          Dental crowns are protective caps that are placed over damaged or
          weakened teeth. They serve to restore the tooth's strength, shape, and
          appearance. Crowns are often recommended for teeth with extensive
          decay, fractures, or after a root canal treatment.

      <article id="dental-bridges">
        <h3>Dental Bridges</h3>
        <p>
          Dental bridges are prosthetic devices used to replace one or more
          missing teeth. They consist of artificial teeth (pontics) anchored to
          adjacent natural teeth or dental implants. Bridges are an effective
          solution for restoring both the function and aesthetics of a smile
          affected by tooth loss.

        <h3>Restoration</h3>
        <p>
          Crowns and bridges are commonly used to restore the integrity of
          damaged or missing teeth. Whether it's reinforcing a weakened tooth
          with a crown or filling a gap with a bridge, these dental solutions
          play a vital role in preserving oral health and function.

        <h3>Cosmetic Enhancement</h3>
        <p>
          Besides their functional benefits, crowns and bridges contribute to
          cosmetic enhancement by improving the overall appearance of the smile.
          Custom-crafted to match the natural color and shape of your teeth,
          these restorations seamlessly blend in for a more aesthetically
          pleasing result.

      <h2>The Process</h2>

      <article id="evaluation">
        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The process begins with a comprehensive evaluation by your dentist.
          This includes a thorough examination, X-rays, and discussions about
          your oral health goals. During this stage, the dentist will determine
          whether crowns or bridges are the right solution for your specific
          needs.

      </article>

      <article id="preparation">
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          Once the evaluation is complete and the decision is made to proceed
          with crowns or bridges, the next step involves tooth preparation. For
          crowns, this may include reshaping the tooth to ensure a proper fit.
          For bridges, adjacent teeth may be prepared to serve as supportive
          abutments for the prosthetic teeth.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="placement">
        <h3>Placement</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, the custom-crafted crowns or bridges are securely placed on
          the prepared teeth. The dentist ensures a precise fit, making
          necessary adjustments to achieve optimal comfort and functionality.
          Once in place, these restorations seamlessly integrate with your
          natural teeth, allowing you to regain confidence in your smile.
